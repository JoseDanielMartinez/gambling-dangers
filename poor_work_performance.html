    <h1>How Gambling Affects the Workplace</h1>

  <article>
    <p> Introduction <br>
      <br>      
      Although gambling is a harmless activity for most people, it has the potential to become highly addictive and the uncontrollable urge to gamble can infiltrate working hours. Gambling disorder is characterized by continuing to gamble despite it causing significant problems, repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down or stop and increased priority given to gambling over other responsibilities, including work. <br><br>

      This blog looks at the impact of gambling in the workplace – how gambling affects productivity and what companies can do to protect employees from gambling-related harm.
      <br>
      <br>
      Gambling at work statistics<br>
      <br>
      Reed in Partnership published a ‘Gambling and Employment’ report in 2016, based on a YouGov survey and interviews with UK Employment Advisers, into the consequences of gambling on work. It found that:
      <br><br>
      More than four in five British adults think that gambling and debt can be a distraction for people at work. <br>
      <br>
      10% of working adults have direct experience of the problems gambling can cause in the workplace.
      <br><br>
      28% of working adults who gamble would prefer to keep their gambling activities hidden from co-workers. This rises to 34% of people who work in finance, accountancy or legal services.
      <br><br>
      72% of respondents think that organizations should be concerned about gambling, with the biggest concern expressed by those who work in financial services.
      <br><br>
      People who work in retail are most likely to have gambled in the past 12 months (56%) and those who work in education least likely to have gambled (39%).
      <br><br>
      People with management responsibility are more likely to have gambled in the past 12 months than those without this responsibility (45% versus 39%).
      <br><br>
      More than one in 20 men sometimes think about gambling while at work, compared to one in 100 women.<br>
      <br>
      The impact of COVID-19 on gambling in the workplace
      <br>
      <br>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of workers across the globe have switched to remote working to help curb the spread of the virus. The social isolation associated with the pandemic and the increased availability and accessibility of online gambling have created a perfect storm. Bored and stressed employees have turned to gambling as a form of entertainment and escape – emotional escapism is a well-documented symptom of problem gambling. The blurred lines between home and work are providing more temptations to gamble during working hours, especially for employees with existing gambling issues, which is making businesses vulnerable to the negative impacts of gambling.<br>
      <br>
      The British Medical Journal (BMJ) has highlighted this issue: “For some people managing gambling addiction, working from home potentially removes some of the safety nets that may help them in managing their gambling consumption. These include supervision and support from managers and other colleagues, online blocking software and the demand of work activities. Working from home may also induce increased usage of gambling apps or websites, in part because boredom stimulates gambling, but also because social distancing and isolating at home will lead to increases in exposure to advertisements via television, online and social media.”<br>
      <br>
      When it comes to online gambling, two jurisdictions make this more complex. For example, some countries allow establishments to open a land-based and online casino, but the citizens are not allowed to gamble. Costa Rica would be an example of this situation. On the other hand, based on the provider’s location, you can engage in gambling activities as long as it’s a legal operator. <br>
      <br>
      This makes it easier for users on a global scale to find a licensed online casino and play casino games from mobile or desktop devices. So, in other words, online casinos are legitimate and trustworthy when they hold a valid license by renowned organizations like the Malta Gaming Authority, UK Gambling Commission, Alderney Gambling Control Commission, to name a few. <br>
      <br>
      It is a significant reason why the online gambling market has thrived globally and attracted different kinds of users, from high rollers to complete beginners. Many casino sites cater to high rollers with special loyalty programs and VIP clubs.
      <br>
      <br>
      Social Gambling <br>
      <br>
      Another form of illegal gambling is coming at social gatherings because obviously, there isn’t a gambling establishment authorized to conduct gambling activities. Any dog fights or illegal poker games constitute unlawful gambling activity; however, if the games are played purely socially without a bookie or host of the game benefiting, that is considered legal gambling activity. <br>
      <br>
      Moreover, due to the rising popularity of social media sites, there were also issues about regulating giveaways, contests, or gambling activities online or through social games. The rise of social media sites and games also prompted online gambling, even though the legislation lagged behind this sector’s tremendous growth. It’s estimated that approximately $4.4 million in revenue worldwide was generated from social media casino games. They come as free-to-play mode, but many of them feature microtransactions and in-app purchases where the user can opt to purchase additional credits, for example. <br>
      <br>
      Conclusion <br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, it depends on the player’s location whether gambling is permitted or prohibited; however, it is a rapidly growing industry that benefits from numerous technological innovations that make it appealing to a global audience. That said, it’s a billion-dollar revenue that doesn’t go unnoticed by governments around the world and in the USA, which is why many of them are open to regulating online gambling.</p>
