    <h1>Effects of Gambling on Relationships</h1>

      The partner of an individual with a gambling addiction also suffers greatly. The increased pressure to financially support the relationship while the addicted partner gambles precious resources away causes intense pressure for the unaddicted partner. This can result in the stable partner pulling away emotionally and physically, putting further strain on the relationship.
      <br>
      <br>
      A common result of gambling addictions and the effects of gambling on the relationship is sexual dysfunction between partners. As a partner loses their sense of security, trust in their partner, or vision of their future together, they will often also lose interest in sex. This reduction in intimacy can be devastating for couples who otherwise would not have experienced a loss of intimacy. Further, the addicted partner’s lack of interest in anything other than gambling worsens this problem over time. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, a gambling addict’s partner may experience trauma disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that can occur when they are exposed to domestic violence or emotional abuse. As tensions rise, partners may begin to fight more. This can escalate into physical violence or emotional abuse from either partner as they both struggle to control the situation.</p>
