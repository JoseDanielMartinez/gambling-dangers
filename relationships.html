      <strong>The Effects of Gambling on Family Units</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      When a member of a family is a compulsive gambler, they aren’t the only person who suffers. Often, the people closest to an individual with a gambling addiction are subject to the consequences of the gambler’s behavior. This is especially concerning when we consider how many people in the United States currently have a gambling problem.
      <br>
      <br>
      It’s believed that at least 1% of the population, or 2.6 million people, have a gambling addiction. This may not sound like a large figure, but we must also consider the effects of gambling on families. Many more people are affected than statistics can show, in these cases. With the accessibility of online gambling, which is considered to produce the same pleasurable feeling of in-person gambling, this figure is expected to increase over time.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Emotional Effects of Gambling on Family</strong> 
      <br>
      <br>
      One of the negative effects of gambling on family takes the form of emotional consequences. Often, to hide gambling, an individual will lie to their family. They may even steal or sell precious heirlooms or household items to fuel their habits. This can cause a range of emotional devastation to a family as they lose trust and respect for the gambler.
      <br>
      <br>
      The tension between spouses is not something that goes unnoticed by children if a couple has them. Children often look to their parents for emotional security and notice when something is off. This can cause children to become entangled in the effects of gambling on the family as they notice a shift in the family dynamics. Children may often even experience the same emotional distress as the affected spouse. These emotions can include the following:
      <br>
      <br>
       <em>Guilt</em>
      <br>
       <em>Anger</em>
      <br>
       <em>Regret</em>
      <br>
       <em>Shame</em>
      <br>
       <em>Anxiety</em>
      <br>
       <em>Insomnia</em>
      <br>
       <em>Depression</em>
      <br>
       <em>Emotional insecurity</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      The most adversely affected relative is often children. They may feel neglected because they’re unable to get their needs met due to time spent away from home trying to make money. Their grades can begin to slip as they experience emotional and behavioral issues at school that prevents them from focusing on education.
      <br>
      <br>
       <strong>Financial Effects of Gambling on Family</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      The financial effects of gambling on families are often particularly devastating. It’s often difficult for a spouse of a gambling addict to find a balance between support and enabling. They may bail their spouse out of debt or supply them with money to prevent them from gambling. However, this can backfire and cause further financial harm. 
      <br>
      <br>
      As savings are spent at the casino, families with a compulsive gambler experience a range of financial difficulties. They may experience bankruptcy, higher credit card debt, and the loss of their car or home. The family may even face eviction if rent payments are unable to be made. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Concerningly, families can even get to a point where they often go without basic necessities. These can include electricity and water as they struggle to keep up with bills as they are due. The gambler may go without needed medical care, for themselves or their children, because they need to save money to pay off debts or because they spend all the money they obtain on gambling.
      <br>
      <br>
       <strong>Effects of Gambling on a Partner</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      The partner of an individual with a gambling addiction also suffers greatly. The increased pressure to financially support the relationship while the addicted partner gambles precious resources away causes intense pressure for the unaddicted partner. This can result in the stable partner pulling away emotionally and physically, putting further strain on the relationship.
      <br>
      <br>
      A common result of gambling addictions and the effects of gambling on the relationship is sexual dysfunction between partners. As a partner loses their sense of security, trust in their partner, or vision of their future together, they will often also lose interest in sex. This reduction in intimacy can be devastating for couples who otherwise would not have experienced a loss of intimacy. Further, the addicted partner’s lack of interest in anything other than gambling worsens this problem over time. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, a gambling addict’s partner may experience trauma disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that can occur when they are exposed to domestic violence or emotional abuse. As tensions rise, partners may begin to fight more. This can escalate into physical violence or emotional abuse from either partner as they both struggle to control the situation.</p>
